# New-Scene-New-Me-Project

Project Requirements
Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, algorithms, and the Theater/Scene API to create your animation program:
Write Scene subclasses – Create two Scene subclasses: one to visualize your 2025 recap (LastYear) and another to project your 2026 goals (ThisYear). Each class must include both a no-argument constructor and a parameterized constructor.
Use private instance variables – Implement proper encapsulation by declaring instance variables as private in your Scene subclasses.
Create 1D arrays – Create at least two 1D arrays to store data for your scenes. One array must be created using an initializer list, and one array must be populated by reading from a text file using the FileReader class.
Write a method – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
Access and modify array elements – Use algorithms to traverse, access, and/or modify elements in your 1D arrays to display personalized content in your scenes.
Use logic and iteration – Incorporate selection statements (if/if-else) and loops (while, for, or enhanced for) to control the flow and display of content in your scenes.
Incorporate variety of media – Use at least four different types of Scene API methods across both scenes (examples: drawImage(), drawText(), drawRectangle(), drawEllipse(), playSound(), setTextStyle(), setFillColor(), etc.).
Create a UML diagram – Design a UML class diagram showing your Scene subclasses with their instance variables, constructors, and methods before you begin coding.
Document your code – Use multi-line comments to explain the purpose of each method (including preconditions and postconditions) and single-line comments to explain code segments.

Object-Oriented Programming
Writes two Scene subclasses (LastYear and ThisYear) that properly extend the Scene class
AND implements both no-argument and parameterized constructors in each subclass
AND uses private instance variables
Writes two Scene subclasses (LastYear and ThisYear) that properly extend the Scene class
AND implements either a no-argument constructor or a parameterized constructor in each subclass
AND uses private instance variables


Writes one or two Scene subclasses
AND attempts to implement constructors, but there are some syntax errors
OR instance variables are not declared as private
Does not write Scene subclasses that properly extend the Scene class
OR does not implement any constructors
One-Dimensional (1D) Arrays
Creates at least two 1D arrays: one using an initializer list and one by reading from a text file using FileReader
AND uses array traversal algorithms to access and/or modify elements in both arrays
Creates at least two 1D arrays: one using an initializer list and one by reading from a text file using FileReader
AND accesses elements from at least one array
Creates one 1D array using either an initializer list or by reading from a text file
OR creates arrays but does not successfully access their elements
Does not create any 1D arrays in the program
Methods
Writes a drawScene() method in each Scene subclass that orchestrates all drawing operations
AND writes at least two additional helper methods in each subclass (at least one void method and one method with a return value)
AND all methods are properly called and executed
Writes a drawScene() method in each Scene subclass
AND writes at least one additional helper method in each subclass
AND methods are properly called and executed
Writes a drawScene() method in at least one Scene subclass
OR writes methods but they contain syntax errors or are not properly called
Writes a drawScene() method in at least one Scene subclass
OR writes methods but they contain syntax errors or are not properly called
Logic and Iteration
Uses selection statements (if/if-else) to control content display based on conditions
AND uses iteration (while, for, or enhanced for loops) to traverse arrays or create repeated visual elements
AND both logic and iteration are used effectively in multiple places
Uses selection statements (if/if-else) to control content display
AND uses iteration to traverse arrays or create repeated visual elements
Uses either selection statements or iteration, but not both
OR uses both but with syntax errors or logical errors
Does not use selection statements or iteration in the program
Theater/Scene API Usage
Uses at least six different Scene API methods across both scenes to create rich, varied content
AND incorporates images, text, shapes, and styling methods effectively
AND uses pause() to create timed sequences
AND successfully calls Theater.playScenes() to play both scenes
Uses at least four different Scene API methods across both scenes
AND incorporates at least two types of media (images, text, shapes, etc.)
AND successfully calls Theater.playScenes() to play both scenes
Uses fewer than four Scene API methods
OR scenes display content but lack variety in media types
OR Theater.playScenes() is called but scenes do not display correctly
Does not use Scene API methods to create visual content
OR does not call Theater.playScenes()
UML Diagram
Creates a complete UML class diagram showing both Scene subclasses
AND includes all instance variables with data types and access modifiers
AND includes all constructors with parameter lists
AND includes all methods with return types and parameter lists
Creates a UML class diagram showing both Scene subclasses
AND includes most instance variables, constructors, and methods
AND shows inheritance relationship with Scene superclass


Creates a UML class diagram but it is incomplete (missing methods, constructors, or variables)
OR does not clearly show inheritance relationship


Does not create a UML class diagram
Documentation
Uses multi-line comments (including preconditions/postconditions) to explain the functionality and purpose of ALL methods in both Scene subclasses
AND uses single-line comments to explain complex code segments and logic
Uses multi-line comments to explain the functionality and purpose of MOST methods in both Scene subclasses
OR uses single-line comments to explain the functionality and purpose of ALL methods
Uses single-line or multi-line comments to explain the functionality and purpose of only SOME methods
OR comments are present but do not adequately explain the code
Does not use comments to document the functionality and purpose of methods or code segments
GitHub
A GitHub repository is initialized with a README.md file, and all .java files and asset files (images, text files) for the project are added to the repository
AND the README includes all of the following:
UML diagram (as image)
Description of 2025 recap scene
Description of 2026 goals scene
List of Scene API methods used
A GitHub repository is initialized with a README.md file, and all .java files and asset files are added to the repository
AND the README includes ALL BUT ONE of the required components


A GitHub repository is initialized with a README.md file
AND some files are uploaded but not all required files are present
There is no GitHub repository on the personal account for this project
OR .java files are not properly uploaded
OR the README is blank
